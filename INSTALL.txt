Before you start ensure that you have a working installation of RBN Aggregator.
This is the conduit for uploading spots to the Reverse Beacon Network's servers.
Also make sure you set up RBN Aggregator to listen to the UDP broadcast port you 
select during the configuration below. 

Download Pavel Demin's SD-card image zip-file for your Red Pitaya 122.88-16
and uncompress it into a folder. It can be found at:

https://pavel-demin.github.io/red-pitaya-notes/sdr-transceiver-ft8/

Copy the content of the folder to a clean FAT32-formatted SD card.
Do nothing more. Do not follow any other instructions on Demin's web page.

SSH to the Red Pitaya. Default user name is "root", default password is "changeme".

Semioptionally - change the password to something more secure

# passwd

Optionally - modify the welcome message to include the identity of 
the Red Pitaya (e.g. "my FT8 skimmer").

# nano /etc/motd

Install git

# apk update
# apk add git

Fetch installation package

# git clone https://github.com/bjornekelund/upload-ft8-to-rbn-2
# cd upload-ft8-to-rbn-2

Install the utilities for config cycling and RBN upload

# ./install.sh

Configure your skimmer. Add grid, call, antenna information (for pskreporter), 
broadcast IP port, etc. as required. 
Enter your device's calibration factor in ppm (with one decimal and a decimal 
point!). If you do not know your calibration factor, leave it at 0.0. More 
information on calibration can be found on the calibration page of my website. 
You may also want to modify the band selection to also include e.g. popular 
Fox/Hound DX base frequencies such as 7056, 10131, and 14080kHz. (Keep in mind 
that the frequency in the configuration file is the band center, i.e. 1.5kHz 
above the base frequency.) This is done by adding/commenting/uncommenting the 
corresponding lines. If you do this, make sure you do not exceed 16 bands and
also keep an eye on the commas for correct syntax. Exit the editor for each of 
the three files with Ctrl-S Ctrl-X. Run the script to the end. Do not exit 
prematurely with e.g. Ctrl-C. The receiver will automatically start when 
the configuration is completed.

# ./config.sh

Check that we are in business

# tail -F /dev/shm/decode-ft8.log

Don't worry about an inital message that the file does not exist. Wait until the log 
file appears. When you are done, hit ctrl-C and log off

# exit

Should you want to understand/modify/build the upload-to-rbn utility, you may find 
it on https://github.com/bjornekelund

To deinstall the additions and return to only reporting spots to pskreporter, do:

# cd ~/upload-ft8-to-rbn-2
# ./deinstall.sh

To update the additions to the latest version do:

# cd ~/upload-ft8-to-rbn-2
# git pull
# ./install.sh
# ./config.sh
