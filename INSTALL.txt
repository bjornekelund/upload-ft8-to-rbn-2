Before you start ensure that you have a working installation of RBN Aggregator.
This is the conduit for uploading spots to the Reverse Beacon Network's servers.

Download Pavel Demin's SD-card image zip-file for your Red Pitaya 122.88-16
and uncompress it into a folder. It can be found at:

https://pavel-demin.github.io/red-pitaya-notes/sdr-transceiver-ft8/

Copy the content of the folder to a clean FAT32-formatted SD card.
Do not follow any other instructions on the web page.

SSH to the Red Pitaya. Default user name is "root", default password is "changeme".

Semioptionally - change the password to something more secure

# passwd

Optionally - modify the welcome message to include the identity of 
the Red Pitaya (e.g. "my FT8 skimmer").

# nano /etc/motd

Install git

# rw
# apk update
# apk add git

Fetch installation package

# git clone https://github.com/bjornekelund/upload-ft8-to-rbn-2
# cd upload-ft8-to-rbn-2

Install the utilities for config cycling and RBN upload

# ./install.sh

Configure your skimmer. Add grid, call, antenna information (for pskreporter), 
broadcast IP port, etc. as required. 
For twilight duration, empirical studies suggest two hours is a good number. 
Should you live close to the equator you may want to use a shorter number, 
such as 1.5. Setting it to zero disables the use of the twilight configuration 
file write-c2-files-gray.cfg. 
Enter your device's calibration factor in ppm (with one decimal and a decimal 
point!) in each of the three configuration files. If you do not know your 
calibration factor, leave it at 0.0. More information on calibration can be 
found on the calibration page of my website. 
You may also want to modify the band selection. 
This is done by commenting/uncommenting the corresponding lines. If you do this, 
make sure you activate exactly max 16 bands and also keep an eye on the commas 
for correct syntax. Exit the editor for each of the five files with Ctrl-S Ctrl-X. 
Run the script to the end. Do not exit with Ctrl-C. 

# ./config.sh

Start

# reboot

Wait for the orange LED to stop blinking, then SSH to the RP and check that we are in business

# tail -F /dev/shm/decode-ft8.log

Don't worry about an inital message that the file does not exist. Wait until the log 
file appears. When you are done, hit ctrl-C and log off

# exit

Should you want to understand/modify/build the upload-to-rbn utility, 
you may find them on https://github.com/bjornekelund

To deinstall the additions and return to only reporting spots to pskreporter, do:

# /root/apps/stop.sh
# cd ~/upload-ft8-to-rbn-2
# ./deinstall.sh


To update the additions to the latest version do:

# /root/apps/stop.sh
# cd ~/upload-ft8-to-rbn-2
# git pull
