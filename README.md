# upload-ft8-to-rbn-2
A set of scripts and utilities for uploading FT8 decodes from a Red Pitaya 
[122.88-16](https://github.com/pavel-demin/stemlab-sdr-notes) based, multi-band FT8 receiver to the [Reverse 
Beacon Network](http://www.reversebeacon.net) via [RBN Aggregator](http://www.reversebeacon.net/pages/Aggregator+34). Although grid is set in the script, call sign and grid associated with the spots are determined by the settings in RBN Aggregator. Based on the [upload-to-rbn](https://github.com/bjornekelund/upload-to-rbn) utility. Additional information [here](https://sm7iun.se). 
Also contains a quick-and-dirty telnet server in perl offering a DX Cluster like stream of spots. (Requires perl to be installed).
